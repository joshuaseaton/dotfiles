# TODO

## General
* Try to redirect auto-generated history files away from the root of the home
  directory and possibly in a more conventional config location.

## Linux
* Make `<Control><Alt>T` open alacritty (ideally refocusing an existing instance)
* Make `<Control><Alt>B` open the browser (ideally refocusing an existing
  instance)

## macOS

## Windows
* Basic support

## Bugs to file
* zellij: ability to open last detached session or open a new one
* nushell: with `sync_on_enter: false`, history won't actually be synced on
  macOS with `<Cmd>Q`
